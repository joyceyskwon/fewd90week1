    <h2>Hi.</h2>

    <p>I was raised an artist. A classical cellist and a pianist at a very young age, I studied with one of the most well regarded names in the classical world, attending San Francisco Prep Conservatory, and now, New York University.</p>

    <p>I found my new passion when I discovered the world of design. Dozens of posters, logos, magazine covers, and other works have molded me into an enthusiastic and versatile designer, whether working with startups, music festicals, or charity events.</p>

    <p>Aside from music and design, I enjoy snowboarding and speed skating.</p>
